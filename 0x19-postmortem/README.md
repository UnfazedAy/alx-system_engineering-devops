Postmortem
Upon the release of Alx project 0x14. Mysql at approximately 18:30 and 19:00 West African Time(WAT) in Nigeria, an error occurred when I tried installing MySQL distribution 5.7.x on my server  web-01 and it returned a broken installation error which led to me being unable to set up a primary replica infrastructure using Mysql at that point in time.  The root cause was that I already had the current version when I tried to install an older version.

Timeline
The issue was detected at approximately 19:00 WAT on Tuesday, November 2022 after I attempted an installation of the same version of MySQL on my web-02 server and it installed successfully. I made online research on the error message I received and got some information on it which was helpful in my debugging and correction process.

Root cause and resolution
Bug debugger Ayomide Soniyi a.k.a Ay encountered the error upon installation and the root cause was that I already had the current version when I tried to install an older version. I promptly proceeded to undergo solving the problem.
Checked to see if any version of mysql was installed by entering the command mysql â€“version.
sudo apt-get purge mysql\*
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/mysql
sudo rm -rf /etc/mysql
sudo dpkg -l | grep -i mysql
sudo apt-get clean
sudo updatedb
sudo apt-get install mysql-client-core-5.7 mysql-client-5.7 mysql-server-5.7.

Preventive measures
If not necessary try not to install an older version of a package or language.
If an older version is needed, make sure to delete the current version and install it.
